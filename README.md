# cold_snap_alberta
There was a cold snap in Alberta Canada last week so I decided to do a little project about it, sourcing for the data wasnâ€™t straightforward I got my list of Canada city from Wikipedia using web scraping, my latitude and longitude for each city using Here API and finally the temperature of each cities between February 7 to February 12, 2021 using Meteostat API.Finally i used Power BI to create my interactive dashboard.
